# Convolutional neural network
# Transfer Learning - applying the learnings from a previous training session to a new session
# Inception model - when we feed in an image at each layer it will perform a series of 
# operations on that data until it outputs a label and classification percentage. 
# Each layer is a different set of abstractions. In the first layers, it basically taught itself edge 
 # detection
 # Transfer learning will basically add a representation of darth vader to its repository of knowledge

# Overfitting
# When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns from noises or unwanted details from training examplesâ€”to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. 
# This phenomenon is known as overfitting. It means that the model will have a difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.


# Steps

1. Get tensorflow to work with a provided dataset
2. Do the same thing but provide my own dataset
3. See if I can classify images into different levels of quality
4. Rather than classification, look to see if I can create a quantifiable value that characterises the quality
5. Turn the number value into an actual price
6. Integrate other variables from the Zillow API such as Bed, Bath, Location, Etc. 
7. Create functionality that will automatically import data from listings that have just come on the market
