# Convolutional neural network
# Transfer Learning - applying the learnings from a previous training session to a new session
# Inception model - when we feed in an image at each layer it will perform a series of 
# operations on that data until it outputs a label and classification percentage. 
# Each layer is a different set of abstractions. In the first layers, it basically taught itself edge 
 # detection
 # Transfer learning will basically add a representation of darth vader to its repository of knowledge
